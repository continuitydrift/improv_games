  <p> act the reckless maskless love.</p>-->

  <p>The simplest games are the best--the ones that are natural, that are already there.</p>

  <p>Children and language both respond to attention. Games usually have something like turns, cycles of input and output, passing some kind of signal around a circle. In software, I recently learned, the turn function, looping through a standard sequence of subfunctions or commands. It is like music, I think, this segmenting and sharing of attention. Spending time together in a non-predetermined spontaneous exchange is like tuning to a common frequency by rythmic or periodic exchange of gifts.</p>

  <p>What will redeem this book, I hope, will be the same thing that in my optimistic moods I think saved my teaching despite frequent lack of preperation (my own fault), or lack of qualifications (my own fault in a different way). When I succeeded, if I succeeded, it was because of the confidence others showed in my abilities, or the institutions set up/maintained/evolved to instill the invisible quality of credibility to one person lecturing to a roomfull of others. I will listen to and collaborate with those who give feedback to both the written and tehnological aspects of this project. The attention that I pay to students when in the class, I will turn to paragraphs, ideas, and anecdotes you might find amusing or instructive.</p>

  <p>The first week I was in Peru, before the classes started, the teachers (three of us) met with an experienced manager of experimental schools, who spent several days taking us through some pedagogy and sample class designs. There was a thickness to those materials, the state requirements, and to the depth of her experience, and her obvious ease with children.</p>

  <h3>nature</h3>

  <h3>everything that happens is important</h3>

  <p>

  <p>Maybe this is a dream, rather than a memory proper, but at one of the many camps I was sent to over the summers for my improvement--this was one a debate camp, or a music camp, or a tennis camp--I was wandering around before the ceremony and walked out onto the stage, with a fair sized audience. It not true, this at least makes a good metaphor for most of my performances or content in life. I wander onto stages or pages, and figure while I'm up there I may as well try and say something worthwhile.
  </p>

  <p>In college, my Junior year, I got an email inviting me to a student leaders' meeting. I went, despite not being the leader of anything ("ummmm...the improv troupe?" I answered when they asked at the first go-round-the-table), and discovered, to everyone's embarassment but mine, that the email was meant with someone with the same last but a different first name. That also, might be a metaphor for my ending up as a teacher, or a writer.
  </p>

  <p>This project seemed like an obvious answer when I asked myself the question of what I knew that might be useful. It is a list that can be added to, by myself or others.</p>

  <p>

  <h3>Use What is There</h3>
  <p>The best lesson plan, like the smoothest script, is less effective than simply using what is encountered in the environment, and responding to it naturally.</p>

  <h3>Stones of Improv</h3>
<div id="Spotaneous Studies">

  I took this class on Russian literature that I really liked in College. Enough that I took another class entirely on Dostoevsky. The fact that there were entire courses on Russian literature and Dostoevsky should tell you something about the kind of institution this was. I was lucky to go there, fortunate that my parents had a sufficient fortune (I see it that way now, but didn't then) to send me there.
</p>
<p>
  While still in high school I'd gone to a kind of summer camp there, an extended campus visit, and one of the professors I got to know, and who I would hold in the highest esteem during my four years there as a rogueish satellite of the theater department, was Sandy Moffett. I would later see him performing at a local open mic at the commjnity theater (where we would put on "Company of Wayward SAints" my Senior year) playing guitar and singing with his wife.
</p>
<p>
  One of the writers we read in that Russian literature class, taught by some young professor (probably an associate professor although I would become thankfully oblivious to such distinctions long after I should have begun to observe them) was Vladamir Nabakov. There was one particular novel that I liked, that I would re-read several times and loan copies of to friends, Pale Fire. It is still, probably, one of my favorite books, although it has been a decade since I read it.
</p>
<p>
  We had one of the other authors, somehow, of a short story we had read, some war story set in the snowy mountains, actually visit our classroom, tell us that the meaning of the text was as much ours as it was his.
</p>
<p>Later, more on less on a whim, I would declare the subject of my Master's thesis at the University of Chicago (it was a one year program in the humanities, a mix of western philsophy and literary studies) to be Nabokov's novel "Look at the Harlequins!" without having read the novel. This was the sort of reckless improvisation that usually, but not always, had positve results. In this case, I found the novel to be fascinating, filled with puzzles, but as an alternate reality autobiography, not satisfying to a scandal-seeking public.

This file, this website, is the stage where I will be performing for a while. There is energy produced when a tempo is established between performers and audience, interchangeable as those groups may be. The thing that I am realizing about web design, probably about any kind of work in the current technologized state of the post-industrialized world, is that there is a built in theatricality. There is a file online, a repository, and when I make changes the time is stamped on the newer version.

Regardless of where the table data is grabbed from, it will be a visible contribution, like someone shouting from off stage. Files are searchable.
