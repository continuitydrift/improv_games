      <h2>Chicago: the intersection</h2>
      <p>A long form performance, the kind we saw so many of at the Improv Olympic in Chigaco, would often start with a word, suggested by the audience. One of the performers would then step forward and start talking, off the top of their head (or out of their ass, depending on which metaphor you prefer), about something, usually a story from their life, related to the word. The rest of the show, sometimes longer than an hour, would be derived from that single suggestion, or rather from the second-order elaborations and emergent scenes, themes, and characters teased out that one word. With the rist of getting too meta, too early, let's say that the word I've been given in "improv." The following is a kind of monlogue, my own riffing on all the associations improvisation has accumulated for me, all the times I've seen it, or used it, in my life. Why? Because I am, in one way or another, a teacher, and improv, I feel, is the key to everything useful I've learned.</p>
      <p>This is not to say that I'm especially good at it, or that I ever have been. Even when I was performing, in high school, college, and then briefly with a troupe at the University of Chicago, I was more the one who laughed at other people's jokes, who came up with ideas for new games, and who drew the posters for the shows.</p>
      <p>I was in a car with some college friends in Chicago, part of the improv comedy troupe of yesteryears. I was visiting, for a wedding or something. We were driving to a party, or trying to find a parking place, or headed to a dinner at someone else's house, or all of the above. If anyone who was in the car is reading this and remembers more details than I do, let me know and I'll put them in a later draft.</p>
      <p>My friends are awesome--I love them. At the same time, Chicago, the big bad wolf of a windy city, scares me and my midwestern picnic basket of habits and safe ideas. I've always looked up to them, and things they like (music, television shows, video games) take on an added glow for me. In the terrible dystopian parlance of advertising I suppose they would be "influencers". Anyway, they influenced me.</p>
      <p>This was the moment, probably, when I lost all of my doubt that these friends of mine--who had been busy honing their improvisational skills in all the intervening years since our "geurrilla improv" shows in the student union, rock gardens, black box theaters, and even once in a bathroom--had left me far behind. I wasn't sad. I was in awe of them, happy that I was lucky enough to know them, to get vicariously some of the heat from the sparking fires of their creative careers.</p>
      <p>There was some unusual or noteable junction, maybe where three or four different roads intersected, or fed into the flower of a roundabout. Music, I want to say Dave Matthews, was probably playing on the radio. When would this have been? I'd probably started graduate school. It probably started with one of them asking a rhetorical question, like "Why must you be so difficult, six-way stop?" or maybe "Why are you still red?" addressed to the stoplight, and another one of them, without missing a beat, responding, in the charater of the inanimate object being addressed.</p>
      <p><i>Personal Relations</i> is a game we used to play, which is included in this book and on the website, where one player delivers a monologue as a character, and subsequent actors take on related personas, gradually building a web of connections and, from that, a story/scene. What my friends did in the car, waiting on that stoplight, was something similar. They created an extended, hilarious dialog between the intersection and the streetlight, or whatever it was, revelating psychological insecurities, idiosyncracies, eliciting pathos and understanding. Like all improv "you had to be there." Other people, less steeped in improv, merely engaged in bantering wit with a group of friends, might have made similar jokes, using funny voices, but then the "scene" would have died, drifing back to more normal conversation. My friends, though, kept the joke going, exploring the implications of what they knew, so far, about the stoplight and the street, long after the car had left the actual intersection behind. They were brilliant. At the party, or dinner, or wherever we went next, they brought the jokes and characters back, inducing the same paroxyms of laughter.</p>
      <p>Those few minutes in the car, I think I can say, were my favorite improv performance, ever. Yes, it was because they were my friends, and yes, it was because it fit with patterns of inside jokes and histories that wouldn't have made sense on a stage in front of strangers, but that is <i>why</i> I loved it so much. I was their only audience. Improvising well, no matter how experienced or talented you are, takes effort and concentration. Enormous amounts of energy. It feels good when people perform when they aren't performing. Not putting on a show in the sense of being false, putting on a mask, but creating a counter-factual reality out of surplus cognition, out of an impulse to break out of the mundane scripts life usually adheres to.</p>
      <p>I was and am jealous of them, of course. I've always wanted to be funnier, quicker, more clever and likeable when I hang out with people, but the truth is, as a conversationalist, I am usually awkward and boring. When I write, though, when I can stand back from a stage and run the thread of what I want to say through my fingers like a rosary, I can approach their level. They are the ones that are still performing, but I am the one writing books. We all have things that we do well.</p>
      <p>There are people who know more about improv, and more about teaching, and are better at writing or front end web design, but it might just be the case that my unusual intersection of prociciencies in all of the above make me qualified to add a little signal around this topic to the internet noise.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="freezeandjustifycar">
      <p>One of my favorite improv games in high school (and one that has been perennially popular with my students) is Freeze and Justify. You can read a more detailed description in the Games section of the book/website, but the gist of it is that in the middle of a scene (the more physical, with broad gestures, the better) an actor will yell "freeze" and those on stage will become as statues, which the new player will tag in order to take their place, assuming as close as possible the original position. The actors then begin a new scene, as different as possible from the previous, but starting from the same physical poses, "justifying" them in a new way. Two people pulling a well-rope might become tango dancers, or a fist-fight might urn into two toddlers with ice cream cones.</p>
      <p>Again, to jump up for a moment to a weird meta-level (a bad habit from literary criticism), if I could somehow play freeze and justify with all the games of freeze and justify I've played, I could switch between several decades and continents. The environment and context would change radically, but the game was the same.</p>
      <p>Let's stick with the car, though, since that was the scene where I left off. Freeze the four of us at the chicago intersection, early thirties or late twenties. Let's say one of the passangers is holding his hands palms-up, in a shrug or gesture that, when frozen and justified, becomes a notebook, geing passed back and forth, in which we are playing a drawing game.</p>
      <p>There are three high schoolers in the car, going into the city to see an improv comedy show. The parent in the front seat is, in memory, interchangeable, since we went several times with different chaperones. Parents were, of course, simply expected to take us everywhere. Driving North into the big city was exciting, smacking of field trips and special occasions, like seeing the lights in crown center for the holidays. In the back seat (was there more of us? Were we in the van?) we were playing 'change-the-picture', seeing how many times we could cause the drawing to drastically shift, kind of an art equivalent of freeze and justify. The idea was to use as few additional lines as possible to effect the largest change in what the picture was. A common and useful trick was rotating the paper 90 or 180 degrees. You had to be able to reduce the drawing to shapes, and then assemble it again into a representation that wasn't there before. A baloon could be turned on its side, made into glasses, which (filling in the middle part with another circle and adding legs) could be turned into a caterpillar, which could be turned into a range of volcanoes, and so on.</p>
      <p>That, also, could be a figure for this book, these strung together bits of observation and memory. I want to draw a picture, to make a point, and then change it, rotate the perspective. The trick to the game is to use what is there, the lines already drawn, but to try and see them differently, to effect a change through tiny alterations.</p>
      <p>High school was where I started doing improv, or at least started calling what I was doing improv. The last chapter of the book circles back around to Kansas, to my childhood and adolescence, but I want to give detailed accounts of my experiences with improvising in reverse chronological order, starting with what I remember best and may be the most interesting: my year teaching at the Kuska school in Ollantaytambo, Peru. The second chapter will be slightly more abstract and theoretical, set in Iowa City, where I went to graduate school, and Grinnell, where I went to college. The third chapter will go back to talking about teaching English overseas, in Romania, China, and France. I will try, personal relations style, to introduce some of the characters that have taught me a great deal, trying not to spend too much time talking about myself. </p>
      <p>This is a text meant to be passed around, added to, interrupted. In a way, I'm adding to the collection of improv games Iput together in 2003, and have been mentally revising ever since.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="louise">
      <p>There was a woman I knew in Peru, the mother of two of my students, who ran a hostel in Ollantaytambo. She and I and Fenja (another of the teachers) talked about starting a writing group, but nothing ever came of it, except she did send me the first chapter of a book she was writing about how she came to Peru. My criticism was that it came off too much like an advertisement, with too much eagerness to impress on the reader how nice and interesting she was. She <i>was</i> nice, and interesteing, but when you write a book about yourself you also need to appeal to the reader as a character, and characters need flaws.</p>
      <p>To warn you, then, I'm going to take my own advice. There are competing influences at play: I want to use these chapters as a kind of portfolio, showcasing my teaching philosophy and experiences and abilities, but at the same time I want to tell a good story, and for that I need to reveal things that are counter-productive to establishing an aura of absolute professionalism.</p>
      <p>I interviewed ...
        next: interview for china, then peru.

      <h3>add-on: inventing rules</h3>
      <p>As a general principle, I want to make the information on this website as open as possible. That way this collection can be added to in the same way that I have assembled it here from memories of other sources. I'm not going back and researching these old books (some of which I will never recall the titles or authors of), but intead using memory as a filter, and trusting the 2003 version of me to give me some good ideas.</p>

      <p>Concrete examples are best. The more of the senses and bodily experience--I wrote in one of my first published articles, for a Romanian teacher's journal--that can be engaged in learning, the stickier the memories become. This isn't going to be a memoir, but nor is it going to be an objective, pragmatic study of the subject. The themes and games-within-the-scenes developed in the following pages will be developed according to the philosophpy I've meant these personal essays to express. The structure will be associative and intuitive more than logical. Like a good improv performance, however, I hope that it builds satisfyingly upon its own premesis and accidental suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>When I was growing up we had a trampline. I was a lucky child. We also had a tree house made from an enormous stump, with a door, ladder on the inside, and second story of a circular platform with a railing. There was a game we would play on the trampoline, that we must have learned from our parents, which I am probably misremembering as simply add-on. My father could do quite a few tricks, and he showed us old 38mm [?] film of his own father doing equally impressive stunts. The add-on game was simply the first player doing something to the standard jump, like a seated bounce, and then the next player adding jump, seated bounce, arm-wave, whatever. With multiple players, (as I say in the description of the teaching version) you could play it as an elimination game. The trampoline version tended to be more athletics than memory based (you had to remember the other moves and actually be able to execute them), but as often happens, we added on to the add-on game, inventing rules and features until it began to dissolve back into that general tapestry of pretend childen so easily inhabit.
      </p>
      <p>
      We would use the trampoline game to tell collaborative stories, where you would re-tell the preceding steps and then, also adding a new physical movement to the routine, continue the narrative. Cousins or friends that my brother and I otherwise might not have drawn out into any real play or conversation in the limited span of time alotted to us could, within the structure of the trampoline game, tell stories that otherwise would never have made it pass self-editing filters.
      </p>
      <p> That is the weird thing about improv games: when you give players a restriction, that should make scene-generation more difficult, like they can only speak in lines of three words, or using consecutive letters of the alphabet, the task of coming up with lines becomes paradoxically easier, since the rule provides a cover or excuse for statements that usually wouldn't be allowed to slip into discourse.

  <p> act the recklessness of maskless love.</p>-->

  <p>The simplest games are the best--the ones that are natural, that are already there.</p>

  <p>Children and language both respond to attention. Games usually have something like turns, cycles of input and output, passing some kind of signal around a circle. In software, I recently learned, the turn function, looping through a standard sequence of subfunctions or commands. It is like music, I think, this segmenting and sharing of attention. Spending time together in a non-predetermined spontaneous exchange is like tuning to a common frequency by rythmic or periodic exchange of gifts.</p>

  <p>What will redeem this book, I hope, will be the same thing that in my optimistic moods I think saved my teaching despite frequent lack of preperation (my own fault), or lack of qualifications (my own fault in a different way). When I succeeded, if I succeeded, it was because of the confidence others showed in my abilities, or the institutions set up/maintained/evolved to instill the invisible quality of credibility to one person lecturing to a roomfull of others. I will listen to and collaborate with those who give feedback to both the written and tehnological aspects of this project. The attention that I pay to students when in the class, I will turn to paragraphs, ideas, and anecdotes you might find amusing or instructive.</p>

  <p>The first week I was in Peru, before the classes started, the teachers (three of us) met with an experienced manager of experimental schools, who spent several days taking us through some pedagogy and sample class designs. There was a thickness to those materials, the state requirements, and to the depth of her experience, and her obvious ease with children.</p>

  <h3>nature</h3>

  <h3>everything that happens is important</h3>

  <p>

  <p>Maybe this is a dream, rather than a memory proper, but at one of the many camps I was sent to over the summers for my improvement--this was one a debate camp, or a music camp, or a tennis camp--I was wandering around before the ceremony and walked out onto the stage, with a fair sized audience. It not true, this at least makes a good metaphor for most of my performances or content in life. I wander onto stages or pages, and figure while I'm up there I may as well try and say something worthwhile.
  </p>

  <p>In college, my Junior year, I got an email inviting me to a student leaders' meeting. I went, despite not being the leader of anything ("ummmm...the improv troupe?" I answered when they asked at the first go-round-the-table), and discovered, to everyone's embarassment but mine, that the email was meant with someone with the same last but a different first name. That also, might be a metaphor for my ending up as a teacher, or a writer.
  </p>

  <p>This project seemed like an obvious answer when I asked myself the question of what I knew that might be useful. It is a list that can be added to, by myself or others.</p>

  <p>

  <h3>Use What is There</h3>
  <p>The best lesson plan, like the smoothest script, is less effective than simply using what is encountered in the environment, and responding to it naturally.</p>

  <h3>Stones of Improv</h3>
<div id="Spotaneous Studies">
<p>
  I took this class on Russian literature that I really liked in College. Enough that I took another class entirely on Dostoevsky. The fact that there were entire courses on Russian literature and Dostoevsky should tell you something about the kind of institution this was. I was lucky to go there, fortunate that my parents had a sufficient fortune (I see it that way now, but didn't then) to send me there.
</p>
<p>
  While still in high school I'd gone to a kind of summer camp there, an extended campus visit, and one of the professors I got to know, and who I would hold in the highest esteem during my four years there as a rogueish satellite of the theater department, was Sandy Moffett. I would later see him performing at a local open mic at the commjnity theater (where we would put on "Company of Wayward SAints" my Senior year) playing guitar and singing with his wife.
</p>
<p>
  One of the writers we read in that Russian literature class, taught by some young professor (probably an associate professor although I would become thankfully oblivious to such distinctions long after I should have begun to observe them) was Vladamir Nabakov. There was one particular novel that I liked, that I would re-read several times and loan copies of to friends, Pale Fire. It is still, probably, one of my favorite books, although it has been a decade since I read it.
</p>
<p>
  We had one of the other authors, somehow, of a short story we had read, some war story set in the snowy mountains, actually visit our classroom, tell us that the meaning of the text was as much ours as it was his.
</p>
<p>Later, more on less on a whim, I would declare the subject of my Master's thesis at the University of Chicago (it was a one year program in the humanities, a mix of western philsophy and literary studies) to be Nabokov's novel "Look at the Harlequins!" without having read the novel. This was the sort of reckless improvisation that usually, but not always, had positve results. In this case, I found the novel to be fascinating, filled with puzzles, but as an alternate reality autobiography, not satisfying to a scandal-seeking public.

  <h2>Bonus Scenes</h2>

  <h3>improv stage: backdrop</h3>
  <p>One of the games on the website (I feel at complete liberty to change the names and "rules" of these games, <!--since this files make no claims on any but naturally demonstrated authority)-->
  since this list is meant as on incomplete and inconclusive contribution to a larger, sustained chorus from the crowd) is <a href="#backdrop">backdrop</a>, where players take turns adding elements to the imaginary setting on the stage. "Here we see a large window with a cracked upper left pane, looking out over a seaside," one actor might say, pointing to the space. Another might indicate elsewhere and follow with, "there is a table with a collection of poems by Wallace Stevens, with two glasses, one empty, and one full of ice." Specifics, in writing and improv, carry more power than generalities to evoke images and associations. When the stage is sufficiently set, the player can begin the scene.
  </p>
  <p>On the date of my first serious drafting session, august 7th, I am standing on wooden planks on top of a shipping container in Ft. Scott, KS. Below me sunflowers flank a small farm house with stones piled up against the side, a frisbee of fossils on the porch railing. My brother is mowing next to the goat pen. Here you can see a black cherry tree, and over there is the hammock I slept in last night. It is cool, and still smells like the morning's rain. Other players might run onto the stage at this point, if this were the backdrop game, and start imitating all of the birds I heard on waking up, bob whites and crows and maybe larks. The rules of all these games are intended to be broken, to be added to or varied.</p>
  <p>Another game I've found to be popular and easy to understand is <a href="flashback_flashforward">flashback, flashforward</a> which is similar to the <a href ="#fasforward_rewind">fastforward, rewind</a>game, but on a larger scale. </p>
  <p>Let's say we added the flashback, flashforward game to the backdrop exercise, so once I was established as typing this on the roof, another (mephorical, since this is the one player version of the writing game) player might jump onto the stage and shout "one year ago" and then another scene would start, with me in the Andean mountains, playing improv games with children. When you imagine these games, you can use these settings as backdrops, or make use of whatever vivid mind-scapes you have close at hand. In mine, there is an octagonal "salon de yoga", with a sloping cane roof, dried bits of it always blowing down to where the sheep were sometimes, grazing, tied. I know the farm and school house well, because I would send the kids out into them, to do surveys of spiders and worms, or bring back something purple or something soft. My eyes scanned the view so many times trying to spy the answer to 20 questions.
  </p>
  <p>More about the Kuska school later. For now let's have another actor run across this narrative stage and say "fifteen years before that" (for younger actors, calculating the differences in years can be a good math exercise) and then two players would take the empty stage. This is how most improv scenes begin, with no established backdrops, just the bodies of the actors in an indifferentiated space. "How is the teacher from America?" one of them asks. "Fine! We've started the theater group. I heard he is doing well." "Really?" The other woman says. "At our school, I heard he is not so good."</p>

  <p>For the website, I want the descriptions to be easy to read, even for those whose first language may not be english. While the construction of this online resource is being "live streamed" a different protocol can come into play. Text can fade in and out of comment sections, drop into more and more buried source files, and then eventually disappear for an edited, formatted, and for-sale re-emergenge. The information in the main table will be kept as open as I found it.

This file, this website, is the stage where I will be performing for a while. There is energy produced when a tempo is established between performers and audience, interchangeable as those groups may be. The thing that I am realizing about web design, probably about any kind of work in the current technologized state of the post-industrialized world, is that there is a built in theatricality. There is a file online, a repository, and when I make changes the time is stamped on the newer version.

Regardless of where the table data is grabbed from, it will be a visible contribution, like someone shouting from off stage. Files are searchable.
