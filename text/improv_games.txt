Living Improv
That feeling, of ambiguity, uncertainty, as any curtain rises. Improv, it seems to me, is stretching that feeling out for the whole show. Learning to inhabit it.
Improvisation as a life technique has positive and negative aspects. On the one hand, lack of forethought or direction, can lead to a meandering plot. On the other, there is something to be said for always being open to little buddhist surprises, momentary awarenessess, lightenings of moods.
Improvisation is difficult to define, although  perhaps not so much as "living." Not that I would to go through such a tedious introductory exercise as definnig terms, merely to point out that by the end of the book I would like to have shown how life and improv imply one another: if something is improvising, it is alive, and if something is alive, it is improvising.
