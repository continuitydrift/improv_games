    ["Add-On Sentence", "<b>Add-on</b> games can be played in a number of ways, all of which draw on the skills of listening and remembering. The Add-on Sentence variation works best with English language learners, who benefit from repetition and practice with pronunciation and grammar.<br>The first player says a word that could be the first of a sentence, and then the next player repeats that word and adds another, while the third then repeats the first two and adds their own. <br>The game ends whenever the sentence is derailed, either by forgetting or a mistake in sentence construction, in which case the error can be explained. <br>If the repetition becomes tedius, players can only repeat the current sentence, and only at the end of the game try to correctly recollect the entire story.<br>Add-on Sentence similar to the game I'm calling One-Word-Sentence, where players tell a story adding one word each (without repeating the previous words).<br><p>It is also possible to provide a suggestion for what the sentences should be about, or come up with one randomly by eliciting a random letter from the alphabet, and then a word starting with that letter.</p>", "esl"],
    ["Add-On Sequence", "In Peru, this game was a good way to keep kids with limited English skills engaged. Remembering a game I would play as a child with my brother and cousins, where we would add on trampoline tricks, trying to do something difficult or silly to see the next players attempt at it, I had them sit in a circle in the gazeebo/'yoga studio', and start off by showing them a goofy sound and movement, such as making a siren noise while patting my head. The next player had to repeat the sound and motion, while adding their own. The following player added their own contribution to the sequence, and the game went until there were too many to remember.<br> Like most games, you could make it competitive by adding the element of elimination.", "verbal"],
    ["Add-On Miming","One way we played Add-on at Grinnell was to have a player come onto stage and establish, through mime, a definite thing about an imaginary setting, for example by going to and opening an invisible window. The next player (after the first had left) needed to reinforce the first object or aspect (acting cold, perhaps, and then closing the window), and then mime a second interaction with some other object, like filling a non-existent glass from an imaginary sink. This would continue until the environment had a fairly well developed lay-out, and could be used in an actual scene.","physical"],
    ["Add-on Drawing", "I've used the drawing version of Add-on within the past year as a warm up with with shy students for tutoring sessions. It was a game I was obsessed with in high school, and have used frequently since. The idea is for each player to change the drawing as much as possible by adding as little as possible. The trick is to see the lines on the page differently, shifting the perspective or context. A ball (encourage the players to start with a very simple shape/drawing, or start the game for them with a random line or scribble, and then describing what it is, e.g. 'this is a ball') could turn into glasses by adding another circle and the frames, and then those glasses could turn into a centipede.<br>In a classroom context (I've never actually tried this) you could use the game to introduce concepts like lines of symmetry, reflection, and rotation.<br>Eventually, the drawing will become too crowded or chaotic too continue. In the case of my friends in high school, this usually involved a final description like 'a blizzard, or 'a child spilled their ink'.","drawing"],
    ["Sentence Picture Game","I learned this game from friends in college, and have used it in many different classrooms and tutoring sessions. You need at least four people to play.<br>Every player takes a piece of paper, and folds it into fourths, horizontally (ending up with four equal rows). Everyone then writes a sentence in the uppermost section. Optionally, you can have each player write three letters of the alphabet, and then pass their paeprs, and then write three words starting with those letters, passing again, to have the third person write a sentence that contains those three words.<br>After there is a complete sentence at the top of each paper, you pass to the person on your right. You then illustrate the sentence, as well as you can, within a limited amount of time. When finished, each person folds their paper so that only the picture, and not the sentence, is visible, and then passes again to their right.<br>This time, each player provides a sentence to caption or describe the picture they were given, and then folds the paper so that only the new sentence is visible. The papers are passed again.<br>After the final turn, once everyone has drawn a new picture, they can unfold their papers and share the progression with the group. The goal of the game, of course, is not to get the sentences or pictures 'right'. It is often more fun to create pictures or sentences that make it difficult for the person to whom they are passed.","writing and drawing"],
    ["Pass the Sound and Motion","Players sit in a circle, and then make a sound and motion which somehow indicates the player to whom they are passing. The indicated player either repeats the same sound and motion, indicating another person in the circle, or alters it slightly.<br>For added challenge and fun, the game can be played with two or more sound/motion combinations being passed at once.","warm-up"],
    ["Pass the Imaginary Ball","Players stand in a circle. One of them starts with a ball, the size and weight of which they indicate through miming. Once the type of ball they have is clear, they then 'pass' it, by throwing, rolling, or handing it to someone else in the circle. <br>The new player acknowledges the type of ball through mime, but then changes it somehow, making it larger, heavier, or bouncier. They then give the ball to a new player, and the cycle repeats.","physical, warm-up"],
    ["Pass the Imaginary Object","Pass the Imaginary Object is a more advanced version of Pass the Imaginary Ball, where the mimed object does not need to remain spherical. <br>The first player, for example, could mime inflating a baloon, and then passing it to the next player, who might flatten it out and turn it into a frisbee. The key is to first acknowledge what the object was previously, and then make it clear before passing what it has become. The passed object might be a pogo stick, a book, a pair of glasse, or anything else the players can imagine and convey with actions.","physical, warm-up"],
    ["Vampires","Roles are assigned, usually by handing out scraps of paper. These include vampires, townspeople, and, in a more advanced version, a vampire hunter.<br>Each turn is divided into two phases: night and day. During the night time, the townsfolk all close their eyes, and whoever is narrating the game says something like 'the people in the small mountain village all go to sleep, and the vampires awake.' Those who were secretly given the role of vampires open their eyes, and silently, using gestures, decide which of the sleeping people in the town will be their victim.<br>The vampires then close their eyes again, and the narrator announces that the sun rises, and the town wakes up, except for the victim, who the narrator announces is dead, and who is from then on out of the game and can no longer speak. Now is the fun part, and the only aspect of the game that justifies using it in a language class: those left alive accuse each other of being vampires, and by the end of the turn, they have to chose a suspect to be killed. Once they have done so, they find out if their victim really was a vampire, or an innocent, falsely accused townsperson. The night phase begins again, and the turns repeat until either all the vampires are killed, or there are no townspeople left.<br>The point of the game, of course, isn't to win or lose, but rather to have fun trying to figure out who the vampires are, and for the vampires, trying to misdirect and trick their victims into killing one another (although being too obvious about a false accusation may lead to your own demise in the next turn).<br>To make the game slightly more complicated, add the role of a vampire hunter, who is on the side of the townsfolk, but can open their eyes in the night phase. They are free to announce who they are, but this might lead to their being killed by the vampires--and a clever vampire might pretend, towards the end of the game, to be the vampire hunter themselves.<br>Note: when I first learned this game from friends at Grinnell, I remember it being called 'Mafia', and instead of vampires there were gangsters, and the vampire hunter was a cop. I switched it in Romania because I got a kick out of hearing students, some of whose accents really were Transylvanian, pretend to be vampires.","role playing"],
    ["Subtext","I've seen this used as an example of how someone could use improv theater for analyzing literary texts. The way the Grinnell troupe used to play the game was with four actors, two of which would portray characters in a scene, and two of which, after a character spoke, would give the hidden, or subtextual, meaning of what they had said. <br>One recurring gag we would use is when one of the characters says something brutally honest, the subtext actor would repeat the original line word-for-word.","acting"],
    ["Subtitles","Similar to the Subtext game, Subtitles has actors in the scene paired with other actors who give a translation of the original lines. Rather than the regular dialogue and then the lines' hidden meanings, two of the actors speak in gibberish, while those providing the subtitles (at Grinnell our tradition was to run across the bottom of the 'screen') translated the lines into English.<br>To give due credit, I'm fairly certain our improv troupe got the idea from the television show Whose Line is it Anyway?, which had an enormous influence on us.<br>For added difficulty, try having the untranslated language be an actual language, but one neither of the actors know. The key would be mimicing the cadence of particular parts of the world without resorting to stereotypes.","acting"],
    ["Straight Face", "The first person to smile or laugh looses. Unlike a staring contest, you are able to talk, tell jokes--anything you like except physical contact.", "acting"],
    ["Battle From a Hat","This is a game we made up at a Thanksgiving get-together with friends in Chicago.<br>All players write on slips of paper three different occupations, and turn or fold the papers so that the words aren't visible. Keeping those cards in a separate pile, you then write down three different objets that can be used as weapons. Finally, you create a pile with three slips of paper from each of the players on which are written three different special abilities.<br>Placing all of the occupations in a hat (or simply drawing randomly from the pile) each player selects an occupation, and then the same thing happens for the weapon cards and the ability cards.<br>Each player should then have a character with an occupation/identity, some kind of a weapon, and a special ability. You might be a door-to-door salesman with a bag of fire ants that can breathe underwater, for example, or a dancer with a slingshot that can make baloon animals.<br>The next stage of the game is the battle. One player announces their occupation, and is challenged by another player, who tells the group who their character is, and why they would win in a fight. The original player can rebut with a reason they would win based on their weapon ('I would sell you a bag, that I told you had cookies but was actually full of fire ants'), and then their opponent can answer based on their own weapon or ability ('I would make a balloon animal to draw away all the fire ants'). The rounds continue until one person concedes, or everyone decides to vote on the winner.<br>Recently, I tried a variation on this game with a younger student, where I had them come up with occupations, objects, and goals (like quests), and then write a short story based on those they randomly drew from the piles.","role playing"],
    ["Comic Book", "This is an acting game we came up with in our college troupe for a super-hero themed show. Actors went on stage and froze in dynamic poses, with their mouth open or closed.<br>Similarly to what happens in the Subtitle or Subtext games, other players would go on stage and indicate which character they were speaking for, and then provide what might appear in the 'speech bubble' of that character. As in a comic book, the dialogue should go left to right, from the top down.<br>Another actor could provide the narration.", "acting"],
    ["Comic Book Puzzle", "Here's one I haven't actually tried, but thought about using in a tutoring session: take a page from a comic book you don't want any more and cut out the panels. Have the students put the panels in the proper order, and explain why they had to go that way.<br>I've seen a similar thing dones with lines of a poem.<br>This is, as I understand it, similar to how a lot of reading comprehension tests work. You are given a short passage and then asked about the order of events. In this case, teaching logical thinking and narrative sequencing is worthwhile, independent of its academic benefit, so my usual dislike of test preparation doesn't apply.", "esl"],
    ["One Word Story", "Each player says a word in turn, or optionally, can end the sentence by saying 'period,' or some other punctuation mark.<br><br>For a more physical game, excellent with smaller children, have them toss a ball or other object around the circle, with the player the ball is thrown to saying the next word.<br>One progression I have frequently used is going from one to two, to three words per player, all the way up to making complete sentences.<br>To help get the game started you can ask for a letters of the alphabet, and then words starting with those letters, and then the title of a story including those words.","verbal"],
    ["Three Line Scenes", "Ralph Hall used this in the Commedia class I took at the University of Iowa, and it was a staple for us at Grinnell as well, where we would initiate it with fellow troupe members around campus for a little micro-burst of improv.<br>One player says a line, the next responds, and the original player completes the scene with the final line.<br>For actors, this can be a great way to lean less heavily on dialogue, trying to establish story elements with expressions or body language. It also helps with pacing--often getting laughs from an audience is just a matter of giving them the space for it. Three Line Scenes help practice the timing of comic beats.<br>Even if you play using just the verbal component, creating a scene with just three lines is a good exercise in minimalism, doing a lot with a little.", "acting"],
    ["Conducted Story","This is a go-to game for me whenever I teach in groups.<br>However many people are playing arrange themselves into a semi-circle around whoever volunteers first to be the 'conductor.'<br>Whoever the conductor points to has to start telling the story, and stop immediately when the conductor lifts their finger or points to someone else. The next person pointed at to continue the story has to do so starting with the very next word that might have been said, not breaking off and starting a new sentence.<br>A variation to make this game more fun and interesting is assigning genres or literary styles to each player at the beginning. When their turn comes, they have to continue the story in their given style.","verbal, storytelling"],
    ["Radio","Radio is similar to Conducted Story, except the conductor plays the role of an old-fashioned radio dial, and when they point to one of the players it is as if the radio is tuned to that channel. Rather than picking up where the previous player left off, it should be as if the channel is in the middle of a song or talk program. <br>The trick to the game, which is possible for advanced performers, is to maintain the illusion of the channel switching being random, but having plausible yet amusing connections between one station and the next, as if one announcer or song is finishing the thought of that previous.<br>The type of stations can be assigned before the game starts, or selected by the players. <br>One variation we used to play in college was where on an agreed upon signal by the 'conductor,' or radio dial (like a hand clap), some catastrophic event would occur in the world, and the radio stations would respond to it in their own ways.","verbal, music"],
    ["Remote Control", "Actors on stage act out a scene, while one player pretends to have a remote control, and shouts out 'pause,' 'fast forward,' or (more difficult for the actors) 'rewind'.<br>You can easily see how the person with the remote can make the game more difficult or easy based on the ability of the players. During pauses, they can also comment on the scene. The game ends when the person with the remote says 'stop'.", "acting, physical"],
    ["Slide Show","Slide Show is similar to Remote Control, except there are two presenters, showing slides from their holiday (for shows, we would usually get the location from the audience). Before each slide, they might provide a quick description, such as 'here we are in front of the eiffel tower,' and then say 'click,' or make an obvious pantomime with the remote, and then other actors would go on stage where the slides would be projected, and create the frozen image, like a photograph.<br>The game works best when the players making the pictures create more and more unlikely or ridiculous poses, forcing the narrators to justify them.","acting, physical"],
    ["Freeze and Justify","This is a classic, one of the first games I remember learning back in Blue Valley High School.<br>Two players start acting out a scene. The game works better the more physical and exagerrated the movements of the players are. For theater troupes, this game can help actors used to watching television internalize the over-the-top movements and pantomime, like ancient greek commedians performing before huge and windy amphitheaters, neccesary for the stage.<br>At some point one of the players watching from the side lines yells 'freeze!' and immediately the two performers should become immobile, including their facial expressions. The actor who froze them then comes on stage and touches one of the players, taking their place and replicating their posture as exactly as possible.<br>The two actors then begin a new scene, justifying the positions they were in, but creating a situation as different as possible from the one preceding it. If, for example, two wresters were engaged in a violent struggle, one's hands around the others neck, then the next scene, starting from the same position, might be a lover straightening their partner's collar.<br>The idea of a new, divergent perspective based on an existing pattern is similar to what happens visually with the Drawing Game.<br>Optional/Advanced rule: we found it was fun to experiment with scenes with fewer or more than the usual two performers. The player who freezes the scene, for example, might tag out both performers, and do a one-person scene based on just half of the tableau. Alternately, the initiator of the new scene could drag another player on stage with them, positioning them like a mannekin.<br>This game, it is worth pointing out, is widely known and used in improvisational communities, and is in no way unique to our group or this site.","acting"],
    ["Puppets","The mechanics of lot of improv games, I feel like, are designed to require people to work together, like cheap team-building exercises at some corporate event.<br>In a game that I'm sure has a better title that I can't think of, two players are on the stage. At Grinnell, we would invite members of the audience to come up and arrange them in their initial position. The rule after that was simply that the actors could not move their own bodies. They were allowed to speak their lines, but any change in position had to be provided (gently) by the puppeteers, two or more other performers who would arrange them like manequins, bending their legs, turing their heads, or swinging their arms. The comic effect came from the puppets trying to justify with their speech the positions into which they were placed, or the movements they were forced to make.","acting, physical"],
    ["Helping Hands","Along the same lines as Puppets, in this game, the on-stage actors would put their hands behind their backs, and two other performers would then get behind them, and thread their own arms through the holes created just under their armpits. While the torso and heads of the visible actors would be carrying out the dialogue and expressions of the scene, the hidden performers would be providing the arm and hand gestures.<br>Again, as with many games, the point isn't necessarily to have the gestures correspond with the logic of the scene, but to provide a visual that was funny for the audience, that the body-actors would then struggle to explain or incorporate.","acting, physical"],
    ["Director's Cut","You get a suggestion from the audience (or, in a classroom setting, provide the suggestion or get one from the students), and begin a scene based on the suggestion.<br>Before too much time has gone by, the player designated as the 'director' yells 'cut!', and stops the action. They then give the actors notes, or feedback, telling them what they can do differently to improve the scene.<br>The actors then take it from the top, using the directorial input, until the director yells 'cut!' again and the process repeats.<br>The game works best the more ridiculous the suggestions given by the director are. In other words, you aren't actually supposed to try to make the scene better, in the traditional sense.<br>A lot of fun can be had by more advanced improvisers playing the character of the actors, as well as their roles within the script. Another performer might play the writer, who also gives feedback, or is exasperated by the director's changes to their work.","acting"],
    ["Novelist","I saw this game in Kansas City when I was in high school.<br>One player sits at an imaginary typewriter, the kind where when you get to the end of a line, you slide the carriage back to the left, and there is an audible 'ding!' As the author describes the scene and characters, actors enter the stage and begin to perorm, in real-time, whatever she or he pretends to write, as if the audience is seeing into their imagination.<br>The actors in the scene or novel supply the dialogue, prompted by the prose that the novel writer says out loud, for example, 'Stacy stares hard at Tom from across the room, and crossing her arms, says angrily...' and which point whoever is playing Stacy would provide the lines her character says. The idea is to flow smoothly between the dialogue and surrounding writing.<br>A different, perhaps easier, version of the game is Playwright, which would allow the author to say the charcater's name before the corresponding bit of dialogue. The playwrights role, in addition to controlling who speaks when, would also be to supply stage directions that the actors follow.","acting"],
    ["Salmon Loaf","This is another game that we adapted from what we saw on Whose Line is It Anyway. There is one player chosen as the host of a party, and then while they are out of the room (or earshot), the audience or other players come up with a list of famous fictional or non-fictional characters. Each performer chooses or is assigned one of this figures, and announced to the audience or group who it is that they will portray.<br>The host returns, and pantomimes starting a party. As per tradition, our troupe in college would, for reasons lost to history, have the party be one in which a loaf of salmon is served.<br>One of the players mimes ringing a doorbell or knocking, with the appropriate sound effect, and then comes into the party as whatvever character they were assigned. They aren't allowed to say directly who they are, but rather are supposed to drop increasingly obvious clues through puns, references, or actions. Usually, the host guesses who the actor is impersonating, and then that charater makes their excuses and leaves. Sometimes, if the guessing is taking too long, a second character can arrive at the party, and drop hints (since they will know the identity of the other person) in the midst of trying to help the host of the party figure out who they themselves are.<br>The more characters at the party, the more chaotic the game becomes, but like other games, Salmon Loaf Party can be good training for giving and taking focus--a skill not only useful in theater, but also in class discussions.<br>The game last until the host either gives up, and the remaining identities are revealed, or until all the names are guessed and everyone leaves the party.","acting"],
    ["Question Game","You perform a scene, or have a conversation, where you are not allowed to make any statements. For an example of a variation on this game, see the movie Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are dead.", "verbal"],
    ["Alphabet Game", "A scene or conversation where every time a new person speakes, their sentence has to begin with the next letter of the alphabet. To begin, you can get a random letter, and the scene can end when the players loop through the alphabet to the original letter.", "verbal"],
    ["I'm Not Doing What I'm Doing", "Usually played in a circle. On person begins miming some kind of activity, like playing basketball or brushing their teeth, and the next player asks them what they are doing. They can give any answer EXCEPT what they are actually doing, and the player who asked the question then begins miming that action, and when the next player in line asks what they are doing, they also give an inaccurate response, and the game continues.", "physical, warm-up"],
    ["Lay, Sit, Stand", "Our thoughts are often disconnected to our bodies. Lay, Sit, Stand, while a silly game, forces players to integrate the spoken aspects of a scene with their physicality.<br>Three people are in a scene. The only rule is that at any given time, one must be laying, one must be sitting, and one standing.<br>When one of the players who had been laying down sits up, then another must lie down, and if that person had been the one standing, then whoever had been sitting would have to stand. The positions don't need to change instantaneously, and the fun and humor of the game comes from trying to provide plausible justifications for the changes.", "physical, acting"],
    ["Mirror","This is one of the most basic games of improvisational theater, but contains the secret to any good improvisation.<br>In pairs, players try to imitate one another's movements exactly. Often, you start by choosing one of the two to initiate the movements, while the other imitates them, switching after a few minutes.<br>The goal, however, and where the secret begins to emerge, is to have the two mirror images moving in sync without a leader, the two actors/players wordlessly communicating, like a oudji [sp?] board pointer, making collaborative and fluid decisions about what happens next, these decisions being invisible to the audience, and ideally not even apparent to the players themselves.", "physical, warm-up"],
    ["Status Reversal","Much was made of status in the books on improvisation I read, and I remember devoting at least one practice at Grinnell to trying to work status into our scenes. The high or low status of characters can be conveyed by things like eye contact, posture, tone of voice, and whether a character is sitting or standing.<br>A fun game is to pick a place or situation, and then designate one player as beginning the scene with high status, and the other as low. During the scene, either at a particular moment or gradually, the status positions of the characters have to switch.<br>A boss berating their employee, for example, may get a phone call from headquarters notifying them that the employee has actually been promoted, and is now above them in the corporate heirarchy.", "acting"],
    ["Emotion Reversal","Similarly to Status Reversal, two players begin a scene with some kind of an emotion, which can be taken as a suggestion from the audience, agreed upon, or drawn from the proverbial hat.<br>If needed, you can also establish a non-geographical location or a situation, or let the details of the scene emerge naturally from the designated emotions.<br>At some point in the scene, or gradually, the players exchange emotions.<br>In a classroom or learning setting (especially ESL), you can have the emotions be secret, and then have the audience try to guess what they were when the scene is finished.", "acting"],
    ["Home Shopping Network", "This is yet another game I saw in Kansas City growing up. <br>Players are divided into two teams, with a person from each team playing the role of the announcer or presenter, who leaves the room or plugs their ears while the items they will be selling are agreed upon. Each item on the list would have a ridiculous element added to it to make it harder to guess, such as a bicycle tire made out of spagetti, or a leaf blower powered by toxic waste.<br>One of the presenters begins their sales pitch to the audience, without any knowledge of what they are selling, while behind them one of their team mates, using cherades, tries to get them to say what the object is out loud. <br>After 30 seconds or so, another player in charge of the game claps their hands or in some other way signals the end of the turn, and the presenter from the other team picks up where they left off, with their team mate likewise gives non-verbal clues behind them. This continues until one of the two presenters says the item out loud (gaining a point), or the director decides to move on, at which time both teams move on to the next item on the list.", "acting, physical"],
    ["Improv to Music", "The mechanics of this game would be different now, with digital music, than it was when we played it at Grinnell.<br>We had some CDs that we put together before the show, contributed by people in the troupe. They couldn't have any words, and were are different in mood and style as possible.<br>We would ask the audience for a number between zero and the total number of CDs that we had, and then another number between zero and the number of tracks on the CD, and then we would play that song, using the music to start whatever kind of a scene that it inspired. That's it.", "acting."],
    ["181","I'm curious if the improv troupe at Grinnell still calls this game 181, which was one of the idiosyncracies of our group (I think the original name, which we misremembered at some point, was 121).<br>You get a suggestion of an everyday object, and then tell jokes that start out '181 ____ (whatever the suggestion was) walk into a bar...' Usually these jokes are short, terrible, puns. The more we played the game, though, the more meta-games we found, for instance creating a disproportionately long and involved set up for a groan-worthy punchline.","verbal"],
    ["Crime Scene","This is a game we invented in college, and that I am proud of.<br>Two detectives come onto a crime scene. When they come upon a piece of evidence, they elicit a suggestion from the audience by leading up to it and then freezing/pausing the scene. In a performance, it might be useful to explain to the audience how this part of the game works. One detective, for example, would be like, 'Look here, Inspector Snigley, I do believe it is our first clue. If you look closely here in the corner, you can see a...' and then wait for someone in the audience to shout out what they can see (e.g., a bloody footprint, or a baseball card, or a hamster wheel).<br>There is, usually, a body on stage, which can be played by one of the actors, and their corpse, and manner of death, would constitute one of the clues.<br>The two detectives after each clue put forward a hypothesis as to how the crime was committed. The trick to the game, we found, was to have the inspectors put forward theories as obviously wrong and far-fetched as possible, while still accounting in some way for the evidence. Both of the detectives can be played as laughably stupid, or one can be an exagerattedly reverse-sherlock, while the other plays a 'straight' character.<br>After this process is repeated three or four times, the detectives put forward their final theories, reviewing the evidence, and then conclude the first part of the game, either by rushing off to try to apprehend the (wrong) suspect, or saying something like 'I guess we may never know...'<br>In the second half of the game, you go flash back to before the crime, when character who had been the corpse is still alive, and you act out the scene of how the murder actually happened. Again, the game is most fun when the actual crime is as dissimilar as possibly to anything the detectives descrived. At some point, all of the pieces of evidence found in the first half have to be left/explained, and the game ends when the victim is killed, ending up in the exact spot where their body was found.<br>This is a hard game, but very satisfying when done well.","acting"],
    ["Detectives","This is a game I remember using in University courses, which is surprising, since it has little to no educational value. I first saw it in Kansas City.<br>Three players are chosen as detectives, and they go out of earshot. The remaining players then decide on three things: a location, the identity of the victim, and the murder weapon.<br>The first detective comes back into the room, and a performer who knows the three pieces of information tries to convey them to the detective without using words. The game works best, and provides the most amusement, if the players can speak, but only in gibberish. That way they can provide clues by tone of voice (impersonating the identity of the victim, for example), and the detective can convey when they have or haven't understood the clue. Usually, the person giving the information will start with one of the three, and only move on when it is clear that the clue has been received. If necessary, a time limit can be imposed.<br>Once the first round ends, the second detective comes in, and the first detective, who previously received the clues, now tries to pass them on as best they can in the same way, using actions and sounds but no actual words. After the location, person, and murder weapon have been conveyed (correctly or incorrectly), or the time runs out, the first detective sits down, the third detective enters the room or stage, and the process repeats for the final time.<br>At the end of the game, the last detective tries to guess the three elements of the murder, and if they are unable to do so, then the second detective makes the attempt, and then the first, and finally the actual suggestions are revealed.","physical, acting"],
    ["Good News/Bad News","This game has worked surprisingly well with English Language Learners of all levels of fluency. <br>It starts with the first player saying 'Good News!' followed by something that would normally be considered good news, such as 'I was invited to a party!' The next player then says 'Bad News!' and adds a negative twist, like 'They sent the invite to me by mistake!' The first or following player (depending on if you are playing the game with two or more people) then finds a way to turn the bad news back into good. 'Good News! They liked me better than their friend who had the same name!' and so on.","verbal"]
